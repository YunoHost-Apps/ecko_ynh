Ecko is beta software, and under active development. Use at your own risk!

* This app requires a dedicated domain or subdomain.
* The user chosen during the installation is created in Ecko with admin rights.
* LDAP authentication is activated. All YunoHost users can authenticate.
* Single sign-on doesn't work.

You may wish to close or limit registration for your instance of Ecko, so that the instance stays small. We invite you to block remote malicious instances from the administration interface. You can also add text on your home page.
